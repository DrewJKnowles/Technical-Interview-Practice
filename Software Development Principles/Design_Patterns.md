## Singleton Design Pattern

The singleton design pattern is a creational pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance while providing a global access point to that instance. 


Implementation of this pattern is to create a class that has a static methog call getInstance, this method returns the same instance of it own class. 

Any regest made to the class will be made at the getInstance method, this will check if an instance exist of not. If an instance of the class exist then it will return that instant to the client. 

1. You can use the singleton design pattern when you want to have stricter control over global variables.
2. Use the singleton pattern when a class in your program should have just a single instance available to all the clients.
